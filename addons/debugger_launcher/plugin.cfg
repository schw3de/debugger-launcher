description="The DebuggerLauncher is a convenient plugin for the Godot engine, designed to enhance debugging processes for developers using C# with Visual Studio. It integrates directly into the Godot editor by adding a toggle button to the toolbar. This button allows developers to toggle whether the Visual Studio debugger should be attached when launching the game. By simplifying the process of connecting the debugger, this plugin makes it much easier for developers to start debugging their game directly from the Godot editor, streamlining the development and troubleshooting process."
